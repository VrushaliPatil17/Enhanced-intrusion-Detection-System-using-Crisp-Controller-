# Enhanced-intrusion-Detection-System-using-Crisp-Controller-
Developed an intrusion detection system with Crisp controller to improve system performance and accuracy. Existing system presents an anomaly based intrusion detection system with the help of Fuzzy controller. Crisp Controller is used to create a detection model in the training phase and update this model in the test phase respectively. Na√Øve Bayes theorem is applied on data sets and characteristics of a system to find the probability of intruder. At the end, System user verifies these decisions and Crisp controller tunes detection model using system user feedbacks to improve the accuracy of detect the anomaly in the system
